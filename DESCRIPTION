Description: This package uses microarray or RNAseq data derived from
    heterogeneous brain cortical samples to estimate the relative balance of each
    cell type across samples. To do this, we include a database of genes that have
    been previously indicated to have cell type specific expression in either the
    forebrain or cortex of humans or mice.
